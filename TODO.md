# Portfolio CSS and Responsiveness Enhancement TODO

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance Mobile Responsiveness: Adjust padding, margins, font sizes, and spacing for better mobile experience (e.g., reduce section padding on small screens, optimize button sizes).
- [ ] Improve Visual Hierarchy: Refine typography scaling, spacing variables, and layout alignment across devices.
- [ ] Add Responsive Utilities: Introduce more flexible grid classes, better tablet breakpoints, and improved touch targets.
- [ ] Polish Interactions: Enhance hover states, focus styles, and transitions for better UX on all devices.
- [ ] Optimize Layouts: Fine-tune Hero, Projects, and other sections for mid-range screens (tablets, laptops).

## Dependent Files
- `src/styles/index.css` (primary file for enhancements)

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test responsiveness on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] Verify theme switching works across devices.
- [ ] Ensure accessibility (focus states, contrast) is maintained.
